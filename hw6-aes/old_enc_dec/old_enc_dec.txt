Note:
I copied the original encrypt.c, decrypt.c, and their original header files to this folder.
Because the homework assignment only required me to encrypt the first 16 bytes of the input
and display the output at each step, the program felt unfinished. I modified the above files
to fit the same format as the DES assignment, in that I print the state outputs to stderr
after each operation on the first round, then repeat the block encryption throughout the
rest of the input file. Because this is done using the ECB (Electronic Cookbook) style, it 
was easy to quickly modify everything I needed to do this with a while loop.
