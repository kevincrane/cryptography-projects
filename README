In general, programs are run by downloading the source code from a particular folder, built with 'make', and run with the main file.
e.g.
make
./hw5

This will print out further usage information about how to run the program.
e.g. for homework 5 (DES)
./hw5
ERROR: invalid parameters. Should be one of the following:
	hw5 tablecheck -t=tablefile
	hw5 encrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]
	hw5 decrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]
	hw5 encrypt3 -k=key3 -t=tablefile [file]
	hw5 decrypt3 -k=key3 -t=tablefile [file]

If you have any questions about to run things or how things work, feel free to contact me at whatever info I left on GitHub.
