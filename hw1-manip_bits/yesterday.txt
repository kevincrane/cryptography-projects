Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though
They're here to stay
Oh, I believe
In yesterday.

Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday
Came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I dont know
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I belive
In yesterday.
