Homework 1 - Manipulating Bits

1. Use
	- Compile with:
		make
	- Display hex dump of input:
		./hw1 hexdump [file]
	- Encode input to Base64
		./hw1 enc-base64 [file]
	- Decode input from Base64
		./hw1 dec-base64 [file]
	- Clean binary files with:
		make clean

2. Design
	- Hexdump
		- Print out the current byte count as a 6-digit hex value
		- Read each byte one by one and print it out as a hex value, putting 
			spaces where needed
		- After 16 bytes, print out the 16 hex values stored as characters
		- Repeat until end of file
	- Base64 Encoding
		- Read 3 ASCII bytes at a time
		- Do bit-wise operations to drop from 8 bits/char -> 6 bits/char
		- Do lookup to see what Base64 matches the 6 bit value that just got 
			made
		- Concat each new Base64 char to output
		* If not enough bytes read, concat '=' to end
	- Base64 Decoding
		- Read 4 chars from input
		- If between A-Z, subtract 'A'; if between a-z, subtract ('a'-26); 
			if '+' -> 62; if '/' -> 63
		- Now have 4 bytes of values 0-63. Do bit operations to convert 
			to 3 8-bit values
		- Print them out
		* If you get '\n' in buffer, skip it
		* If you get '=' in buffer, end.
		* If value not in ranges listed above, print to stderr that the input 
			file does not contain valid Base64 characters, end program
